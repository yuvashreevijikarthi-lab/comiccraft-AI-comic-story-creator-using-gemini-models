ComicCraft — AI Comic Story Creator
ComicCraft turns a story idea into a five-panel comic. Gemini writes the story; Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face Diffusers) draws the panels; the result is shown in the browser and exported as a PDF.

How it works
Outline — Gemini (GEMINI_OUTLINE_MODEL, default gemini-3.8-flash) writes a 5-panel outline with an image prompt per panel.
Story — Gemini (GEMINI_STORY_MODEL, default gemini-3.1-pro-preview) adds captions, narration and dialogue.
Images — Stable Diffusion renders each panel into static/panels/ (or a placeholder image, see below).
Layout + PDF — panels are combined and exported with FPDF2 into static/exports/.
Stack: FastAPI + Jinja2, google-genai, diffusers / transformers / torch, FPDF2, Pillow.

Requirements
Python 3.11 or newer (tested on 3.14)
A Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
For real images: several GB of disk for the model; an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended
Quick start — Windows (PowerShell)
cd ComicCraft
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
Open .env and set GEMINI_API_KEY. Keep .env private — it is listed in .gitignore.

Fast smoke test (no Stable Diffusion download)
In .env set:

IMAGE_PROVIDER=placeholder
Then start the server:

python -m app.main
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000. (uvicorn app.main:app --reload also works.) python -m app.main uses APP_HOST, APP_PORT and DEBUG (auto-reload) from .env.

Real image generation
Set IMAGE_PROVIDER=diffusers. The first generation downloads the checkpoint in IMAGE_MODEL_ID (about 4 GB for Stable Diffusion 1.5).

GPU note: pip install -r requirements.txt installs the CPU-only PyTorch build on Windows. CPU generation works but takes minutes per panel. For an NVIDIA GPU, reinstall PyTorch with the CUDA build from the selector at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/, for example:

pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
Check with python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())". On CUDA the pipeline runs in float16 to save memory.

If the model needs Hugging Face authentication, set HF_TOKEN in .env.

Configuration (.env)
Variable	Default	Purpose
GEMINI_API_KEY	—	Required. Gemini API key.
GEMINI_OUTLINE_MODEL	gemini-3.8-flash	Model for the 5-panel outline.
GEMINI_STORY_MODEL	gemini-3.1-pro-preview	Model for narration and dialogue.
GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL	empty	Optional model to switch to when the models above run out of quota (HTTP 429).
IMAGE_PROVIDER	diffusers	diffusers for real images, placeholder for quick tests.
IMAGE_MODEL_ID	stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5	Hugging Face model ID.
IMAGE_STEPS / IMAGE_WIDTH / IMAGE_HEIGHT	20 / 512 / 512	Diffusion settings.
SEED	42	Base seed; panel n uses SEED + n.
HF_TOKEN	empty	Hugging Face token for gated models.
APP_HOST / APP_PORT / DEBUG	127.0.0.1 / 8000 / true	Used by python -m app.main.
Model IDs change over time; if a call fails with "model not found", pick a current ID from https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models and update .env.

API
Method & path	Description
GET /	Web UI
POST /generate	Form submission; returns the comic preview page
POST /generate-comic/json	JSON API; returns title, panels and pdf_path
POST /export-json	Re-export a layout (from the JSON API) to a new PDF
GET /download/{filename}	Download an exported PDF
POST /test-image	Generate one image from a prompt form field
GET /docs	Swagger UI
Example body for POST /generate-comic/json:

{
  "story_prompt": "A brave fox explores an enchanted forest.",
  "character_name": "Luna",
  "setting": "Enchanted forest",
  "tone": "Funny",
  "art_style": "Comic book"
}
/export-json only accepts panel images under /static/panels/, and /download only serves PDFs from static/exports/.

Testing
Set IMAGE_PROVIDER=placeholder and a valid GEMINI_API_KEY.
Run python -m app.main and submit the form at http://127.0.0.1:8000 — you should see five panels and a working Download PDF button.
Or open /docs, choose POST /generate-comic/json, click Try it out, paste the example body and execute.
Troubleshooting
pip install fails with ResolutionImpossible — use the current requirements.txt (diffusers 0.40 needs transformers 5.x).

GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured — copy .env.example to .env and add the key, then restart the server.

Gemini 404 / model not found / "no longer available to new users" — the model ID isn't available to your key; change GEMINI_OUTLINE_MODEL / GEMINI_STORY_MODEL (e.g. gemini-2.5-pro is closed to new users).

Gemini 429 / quota exceeded — your plan has no (or no remaining) quota for that model. Each comic makes 2 Gemini calls (outline + story).

Per-minute limit: the app waits the delay Gemini asks for and retries once automatically.
Daily limit (...PerDay... in the details, e.g. 20 requests/day on the free tier): waiting a minute won't help; the quota resets at midnight Pacific time. Free-tier quotas are per model, so set GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL (or change GEMINI_OUTLINE_MODEL / GEMINI_STORY_MODEL) to another model your key can use, or enable billing.
Free-tier keys often have no Pro quota at all: set GEMINI_STORY_MODEL to a Flash model.
Gemini 503 / high demand — temporary overload; the app retries 3 times automatically, then asks you to try again later.

GET /generate 405 — no longer happens; refreshing a result page now redirects to the home page.

Gemini returned an empty response — the prompt was likely blocked by safety filters; rephrase the story.

Generation is very slow — you are on CPU; use IMAGE_PROVIDER=placeholder or install CUDA PyTorch (see above).

CUDA out of memory — lower IMAGE_WIDTH/IMAGE_HEIGHT or IMAGE_STEPS.

Model access error — accept the model's license on Hugging Face and set HF_TOKEN.

Special characters in the PDF — the PDF uses a built-in Latin font; curly quotes and dashes are converted, and unsupported characters (e.g. emoji) appear as ?.
